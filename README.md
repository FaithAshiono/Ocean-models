# Ocean-models

Define Your Study Area
Select specific coastal areas in Ghana and Kenya for comparison. Focus on areas with distinct continental shelf features or notable oceanographic differences.
Tools: Use Google Earth Pro or QGIS to outline your regions of interest (ROIs).
2. Collect Bathymetric Data
Download bathymetric data from the following sources:

GEBCO 2023 Grid: Global high-resolution bathymetric dataset (15-arcsecond resolution).
Download GEBCO Data
Copernicus Marine Service: Provides global ocean depth and current datasets.
Access CMEMS
ETOPO1: A 1-arcminute global topography/bathymetry dataset.
Get ETOPO Data
If you want higher resolution near the shore, consider downloading Sentinel-2 imagery for shallow water depth modeling (e.g., using reflectance).

3. Process the Data
Step 1: Import Bathymetric Data into GIS
Use QGIS (or ArcGIS) to load the bathymetric raster data.
Add coastline shapefiles for Ghana and Kenya to provide context (e.g., from Natural Earth Data or GADM).
Step 2: Extract Continental Shelf Information
Use the contour tool in QGIS or ArcGIS to generate depth contours (e.g., -50m, -100m, -200m).
Identify the continental shelf break (usually ~200m depth contour).
Measure the distance from the coastline to the shelf break using the distance tool along transects.
Step 3: Create Bathymetric Profiles
Use the Profile Tool plugin in QGIS to draw cross-sectional transects from the shore to the open ocean.
Generate graphs showing how the seafloor depth changes with distance from the coastline for both Ghana and Kenya.
4. Analyze the Results
Compare Proximity of the Shelf Break:
Create a map highlighting the continental shelf's edge for both Ghana and Kenya.
Use transects to measure and compare how far the shelf extends offshore.
Relate Depth to Coastal Dynamics:
Discuss how differences in the continental shelfâ€™s depth and proximity might influence wave behavior (e.g., shallower shelves dissipate wave energy more quickly).
5. Visualize and Document Your Findings
Create Maps:
Include detailed bathymetric maps showing depth contours and shelf break distances.
Generate Graphs:
Include depth profiles for Ghana and Kenya, comparing their seafloor gradients.
Write a Report:
Summarize your methodology, findings, and implications of continental shelf differences on coastal dynamics.
Use Software:
Tools like Canva, Inkscape, or PowerPoint can enhance the design of your maps and charts.
